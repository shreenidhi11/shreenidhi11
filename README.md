## Hi there 👋 I'm Shreenidhi Acharya

I’m a Linux enthusiast and backend developer with 3.5 years of industry experience in building scalable, secure, and performant systems. Currently, I’m a recent Master’s in Computer Science Graduate from Rochester Institute of Technology, with a focus on backend development, system optimization, and cloud-integrated solutions.

🚀 Lately, I’ve developed a strong interest in **building scalable data pipelines** using **Apache Airflow** to simplify and automate complex data ingestion tasks.  
📊 My recent capstone project involves building an **Employment Recommendation System and Skill Gap Analysis Engine** using NLP, clustering, and similarity matching techniques to help job seekers identify roles and missing skills based on their resume.
