Hi there 👋 I'm Shreenidhi Acharya  

I’m a Linux enthusiast and backend engineer passionate about building robust, intelligent systems that make technology more efficient and accessible. I have 3.5 years of industry experience designing scalable, secure, and performant backend solutions.  

💡 Recently, I’ve been exploring how AI can enhance system-level workflows — from intelligent automation to self-optimizing infrastructure. I enjoy blending my love for Linux and backend engineering with applied AI to solve real-world challenges.  

🏆 I’m also a hackathon winner! At WiCHacks, my team built a **Lost and Found website** powered by **React, Flask, and ML-based item matching**, which won the **Best UI/UX and Accessibility** award.
